# css.city

Website for illustrating the world of CSS possibilities. This site builds on [html.haus](https://html.haus/), which will teach you HTML. Start there if you haven't learned HTML yet. If HTML is the haus ('house') or structure of webpages, then CSS is the paint, the lights, the trim, the style for houses, which makes the beautiful city that is the web possible.

I recently returned to the world of web development, and I've been delighted to learn how far CSS has come, especially in light of modern UI development frameworks which support _all sorts of strategies_ for styling components. [css.city](https://css.city/) is an introduction to CSS, a reference for common CSS strategies, CSS styles to get you started, and a guide on the various CSS approaches in modern web development.
