      <h1>Learn CSS</h1>
      <p>
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.  CSS is a sister technology to Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), because it enables you to modify the
        appearance of your HTML.  If you think of a website as a house, then HTML is used to provide structure like the frame, walls, appliances
        and furniture, while CSS is used to paint the walls, hang the lights, frame the pictures, and position your furniture.  This introduction to 
        CSS assumes that you know basic HTML.  If you have not learned HTML fundamentals yet, then I recommend you do that first by checking out 
        <a href="https://html.haus/learn.html">HTML.Haus</a> for an easy to read singe page tutorial.
      </p>
      <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
      <p>
        CSS is a programming language for styling webpages written in HTML.  You can change the color and size of HTML elements with CSS.  You can change the font of
        textual elements, as well as font characteristics like bold, italics, and spacing.  You can change the layout of a webpage as well as how and where the
        elements display on the page.  If HTML lets you build with raw materials, then CSS gives you a paint brush, a measuring tape, a level, all the tools
        you need to refine the appearance, layout, and style of a webpage.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you completed the <a href="https://html.haus/learn.html">HTML.Haus</a> tutorial, then you've already seen a little CSS, at least in its simplest
        form.  The easiest way to start using CSS is by applying it directly to individual elements using the <em>style</em> attribute in your HTML:
      </p>
      <textarea>
<p style="color: royalblue">She's a brick haus!</p>
      </textarea>
      <p style="color: royalblue">She's a brick haus!</p>
      <h3>Inline Styles</h3>
      <p>
        This way of using CSS is called in-line styling, because the styles appear in the same line as the HTML.  You can probably see the shortcomings
        of this approach almost immediately.  If you want to make all your paragraphs display in blue, then you'll have to add this style attribute to each one.
        That's going to quickly add up to a lot of duplicative work, and if you ever want to change the color later on, then it'll be even more work to update
        each one.
      </p>
      <h3>Build to Learn</h3>
      <p>
        Before we go any further, as a part of active learning it's important to do exercises and practice, as well as read and comprehend. 
        Actively exercising the knowledge you just learned actually ingrains that knowledge in your brain, making it accessible later on. 
        For that reason, for every concept we learn, I highly recommend you try it yourself. Take the sample I provide and make it your own 
        by changing the styling.  Typing it out and practicing will really, truly help with your retention. You will learn best through this 
        tutorial by building a number of sample pages and styling them alongside the exercises.
      </p>
      <p>
        Learn as you build.
      </p>
      <h3>Embedded Styles</h3>
      <p>
        Let's get back to our problem of having to add a style attribute to every HTML element we want to change.  There's an easier way to do this.  
        If you want to add styles to an entire page, then you can also put these in the head section of your HTML.
      </p>
      <p>Here's an example:</p>
      <textarea rows="18">
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>CSS Playground</title>
    <style>
      p {
        color: royalblue;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Let's Paint the Town</h1>
    <p>I'm excited you're starting your CSS journey. Let's learn how to style together!</p>
    <p>We'll be stronger together, and learning CSS while expanding your knowledge of HTML is the way to go.</p>
  </body>
</html>
      </textarea>
      <p>
        Copy and paste the textarea above into a blank file and save it as 'index.html'.  Opening it with a browser will give you a playground where 
        you can safely complete the rest of these exercises and continue learning CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you can see in your local playground, we've changed the color of both paragraphs.  How'd we do it?  These 5 lines of code:
      </p>
      <textarea rows="6">
<style>
  p {
    color: royalblue;
  }
</style>
      </textarea>
      <p>What we see defined above is a CSS rule.  Each CSS rule is composed of three parts: selector, property, and value:</p>
      <img class="diagram" src="assets/style-embedded.svg" alt="annotated diagram of style element" height="160">
      <p>These three parts break down succinctly as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Selector defines the target of the rule or what part of the HTML this rule will be applied on (e.g. all p tags or paragraphs).</li>
        <li>Property defines what about the target is going to be changed, so in this case it's the font color of paragraphs.</li>
        <li>Value defines the property's new setting, so in this case, the font color property now has a value of royalblue.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Think of all the HTML elements you know.  You can now change the color of anything!</p>
      <h2>Selectors</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Element</li>
        <li>Class</li>
        <li>Identifier</li>
        <li>Important</li>
        <li></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Properties</h2>
      <h3>Cascade</h3>
      Define the cascade and explain why it's called Cascading Style Sheets
      <h3>Inline Styles</h3>
      Explain how inline styles will beat out other selectors
      <h2>Box Model</h2>
      <h2>Positioning</h2>
      <h2>Display</h2>
      <h2>Colors</h2>
      <h2>Typography</h2>
      <h2>Grid</h2>
