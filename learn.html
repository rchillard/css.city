      <h1>Learn CSS</h1>
      <p>
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.  CSS is a sister technology to Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), because it enables you to modify the
        appearance of your HTML.  If you think of a website as a house, then HTML is used to provide structure like the frame, walls, appliances
        and furniture, while CSS is used to paint the walls, hang the lights, frame the pictures, and position your furniture.  This introduction to 
        CSS assumes that you know basic HTML.  If you have not learned HTML fundamentals yet, then I recommend you do that first by checking out 
        <a href="https://html.haus/learn.html">HTML.Haus</a> for an easy to read singe page tutorial.
      </p>
      <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
      <p>
        CSS is a programming language for styling webpages written in HTML.  You can change the color and size of HTML elements with CSS.  You can change the font of
        textual elements, as well as font characteristics like bold, italics, and spacing.  You can change the layout of a webpage as well as how and where the
        elements display on the page.  If HTML lets you build with raw materials, then CSS gives you a paint brush, a measuring tape, a level, all the tools
        you need to refine the appearance, layout, and style of a webpage.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you completed the <a href="https://html.haus/learn.html">HTML.Haus</a> tutorial, then you've already seen a little CSS, at least in its simplest
        form.  The easiest way to start using CSS is by applying it directly to individual elements using the <em>style</em> attribute in your HTML:
      </p>
      <textarea>
<p style="color: royalblue">Think of London, a small city</p>
      </textarea>
      <p style="color: royalblue">Think of London, a small city</p>
      <h3>Inline Styles</h3>
      <p>
        This way of using CSS is called in-line styling, because the styles appear in the same line as the HTML.  You can probably see the shortcomings
        of this approach almost immediately.  If you want to make all your paragraphs display in blue, then you'll have to add this style attribute to each one.
        That's going to quickly add up to a lot of duplicative work, and if you ever want to change the color later on, then it'll be even more work to update
        each one.
      </p>
      <h3>Build to Learn</h3>
      <p>
        Before we go any further, as a part of active learning it's important to do exercises and practice, as well as read and comprehend. 
        Actively exercising the knowledge you just learned actually ingrains that knowledge in your brain, making it accessible later on. 
        For that reason, for every concept we learn, I highly recommend you try it yourself. Take the sample I provide and make it your own 
        by changing the styling.  Typing it out and practicing will really, truly help with your retention. You will learn best through this 
        tutorial by building a number of sample pages and styling them alongside the exercises.
      </p>
      <p>
        Learn as you build.
      </p>
      <h3>Embedded Styles</h3>
      <p>
        Let's get back to our problem of having to add a style attribute to every HTML element we want to change.  There's an easier way to do this.  
        If you want to add styles to an entire page, then you can also put these in the head section of your HTML.
      </p>
      <p>Here's an example:</p>
      <textarea rows="18">
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>CSS Playground</title>
    <style>
      p {
        color: royalblue;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Let's Paint the Town</h1>
    <p>I'm excited you're starting your CSS journey. Let's learn how to style together!</p>
    <p>We'll be stronger together, and learning CSS while expanding your knowledge of HTML is the way to go.</p>
  </body>
</html>
      </textarea>
      <p>
        Copy and paste the textarea above into a blank file and save it as 'index.html'.  Opening it with a browser will give you a playground where 
        you can safely complete the rest of these exercises and continue learning CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you can see in your local playground, we've changed the color of both paragraphs.  How'd we do it?  These 5 lines of code:
      </p>
      <textarea rows="6">
<style>
  p {
    color: royalblue;
  }
</style>
      </textarea>
      <p>What we see defined above is a CSS rule.  Each CSS rule is composed of three parts: selector, property, and value:</p>
      <img class="diagram" src="assets/style-embedded.svg" alt="annotated diagram of style element" height="160">
      <p>These three parts break down succinctly as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Selector</strong> defines the target of the rule or what part of the HTML this rule will be applied on (e.g. all p tags or paragraphs).</li>
        <li><strong>Property</strong> defines what about the target is going to be changed, so in this case it's the font color of paragraphs.</li>
        <li><strong>Value</strong> defines the property's new setting, so in this case, the font color property now has a value of royalblue.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This second way of defining styles is more useful, because you can define rules that apply to an entire HTML webpage.  Think of all the HTML elements you know.  
        You can now change the color of anything!  However, once again, you're probably already asking questions about the shortcomings that might accompany using the 
        style tag in the head of your document.
      </p>
      <p>Questions like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What if I have a lot of CSS rules?  My head element will be really big.</li>
        <li>What if I want to share the same styles across multiple pages?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The final (most widely accepted) way to incorporate CSS into HTML is through using external stylesheets.</p>
      <h3>External Styles</h3>
      <p>
        You can link to a separate CSS file where you save all of your rules apart from your HTML.  This answers both of the questions above, because now you can reference
        as many external stylesheets as you need, and you only need a single line of code for each stylesheet.  Let's see what that looks like:
      </p>
      <p>Your <strong>index.html</strong> file would contain the following:</p>
      <textarea rows="14">
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>CSS Playground</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Let's Paint the Town</h1>
    <p>I'm excited you're starting your CSS journey. Let's learn how to style together!</p>
    <p>We'll be stronger together, and learning CSS while expanding your knowledge of HTML is the way to go.</p>
  </body>
</html>
      </textarea>
      <p>While your <strong>styles.css</strong> file would contain the rule:</p>
      <textarea rows="4">
p {
  color: royalblue;
}
      </textarea>
      <p>
        By adding the link element, identifying the relative reference as being to a stylesheet, and through using the href attribute to refer to the location of that stylesheet, 
        you tell the browser what CSS rules to apply to the HTML document it just received.  The CSS sheet referenced can contain any number of rules.
      </p>
      <h2>Selectors</h2>
      <p>
        Selectors define the target for the CSS rule you're defining, and up until now, we've only seen one type of selector for elements.  The element selector is powerful, because
        you can modify the display properties of all the instances of that element on a page, but what if you want to be more <em>selective</em> and only target certain elements?
      </p>
      <p>That's where the additional selectors come in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Element</strong> selectors refer to HTML elements by type (e.g. p) and change all the instances of that element on a page</li>
        <li><strong>Class</strong> selectors refer to HTML elements by their class attribute.  class is a global HTML attribute available to all elements</li>
        <li><strong>Identifier</strong> selectors refer to a single specific HTML element as defined by the id attribute assigned to it.  id is also global.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Class</h3>
      <p>
        The class attribute can be applied to any HTML element, and it can be used to span different types of elements, so that you can easily select them in your CSS by using
        the class selector.  The class selector syntax is a period . followed by the name of your class.  For example:
      </p>
      <textarea rows="6">
.lyrics {
  color: royalblue;
  line-height: 120%;
}
      </textarea>
      <p>When applied to a set of song lyrics like this one would appear as:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="lyrics">
          Think of London, a small city
        </p>
        <p class="lyrics">
          It's dark, dark in the daytime<br>
          The people sleep, sleep in the daytime<br>
          If they want to, if they want to
        </p>
        <p class="lyrics">
          I'm checking them out<br>
          I'm checking them out<br>
          I got it figured out<br>
          I got it figured out<br>
          There's good points and bad points<br>
          Find a city<br>
          Find myself a city to live in...
        </p>
