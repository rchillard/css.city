    <h1>Learn CSS</h1>
    <p>
      CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is a sister technology to Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), because it
      enables you to modify the
      appearance of your HTML. If you think of a website as a house, then HTML is used to provide structure like the
      frame, walls, appliances
      and furniture, while CSS is used to paint the walls, hang the lights, frame the pictures, and even to position
      your furniture. This introduction
      to CSS assumes that you know basic HTML. If you have not learned HTML yet, then I recommend you do that first by
      checking out
      <a href="https://html.haus/learn.html">HTML.Haus</a> for an easy to read singe page tutorial.
    </p>
    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <p>
      CSS is a specific language for styling web pages written in HTML. You can change the color and size of HTML
      elements with CSS. You can change the font of
      textual elements, as well as characteristics like bold, italics, and spacing. You can change the layout of a web
      page as well as where the
      elements display on the page. If HTML lets you build with raw materials, then CSS gives you a paint brush, a
      measuring tape, a level, all the tools
      you need to refine the appearance, layout, and style of a page.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you completed the <a href="https://html.haus/learn.html">HTML.Haus</a> tutorial, then you've already seen a
      little CSS, at least in its simplest
      form. The easiest way to start using CSS is by applying it directly to individual elements using the
      <em>style</em> attribute in your HTML:
    </p>
    <textarea>
<p style="color: royalblue">Think of London, a small city</p>
      </textarea>
    <p style="color: royalblue">Think of London, a small city</p>
    <h3>Inline Styles</h3>
    <p>
      This way of using CSS is called in-line styling, because the styles appear in the same line as the HTML. You can
      probably see the shortcomings
      of this approach almost immediately. If you want to make all your paragraphs display in blue, then you'll have to
      add this style attribute to each one.
      That's going to quickly add up to a lot of duplicative work, and if you ever want to change the color later on,
      then it'll be even more work to update
      each one.
    </p>
    <h3>Build to Learn</h3>
    <p>
      Before we go any further, as a part of active learning it's important to do exercises and practice, as well as
      read and comprehend.
      Actively exercising the knowledge you just learned actually ingrains that knowledge in your brain, making it
      accessible later on.
      For that reason, for every concept we learn, I highly recommend you try it yourself. Take the sample I provide and
      make it your own
      by changing the styling. Typing it out and practicing will really help with your retention. You will learn best
      through this
      tutorial by building a number of sample pages and styling them alongside the exercises.
    </p>
    <p>
      Learn as you build.
    </p>
    <h3>Embedded Styles</h3>
    <p>
      Let's get back to our problem of having to add a style attribute to every HTML element we want to change. There's
      an easier way to do this.
      If you want to add styles to an entire page, then you can also put these in the head section of your HTML.
    </p>
    <p>Here's an example:</p>
    <textarea rows="18">
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>CSS Playground</title>
    <style>
      p {
        color: royalblue;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Let's Paint the Town</h1>
    <p>I'm excited you're starting your CSS journey. Let's learn how to style together!</p>
    <p>We'll be stronger together, and learning CSS while expanding your knowledge of HTML is the way to go.</p>
  </body>
</html>
      </textarea>
    <p>
      Copy and paste the code above into a text editor and save it as 'index.html'. Opening it with a browser will give
      you a local playground where
      you can safely complete the rest of these exercises and continue learning CSS. Just save your file, then reload
      your browser to see your changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you can see in your local playground, we've changed the color of both paragraphs. How'd we do it? These 5 lines
      of code:
    </p>
    <textarea rows="6">
<style>
  p {
    color: royalblue;
  }
</style>
      </textarea>
    <p>What we see defined above is a CSS rule. Each CSS rule is composed of three parts: selector, property, and value:
    </p>
    <img class="diagram" src="assets/style-embedded.svg" alt="annotated diagram of style element" height="160">
    <p>These three parts break down succinctly as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Selector</strong> defines the target of the rule or what part of the HTML this rule will be applied on
        (e.g. all p tags or paragraphs).</li>
      <li><strong>Property</strong> defines what about the target is going to be changed, so in this case it's the font
        color of paragraphs.</li>
      <li><strong>Value</strong> defines the property's new setting, so in this case, the font color property now has a
        value of royalblue.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This second way of defining styles is more useful, because you can define rules that apply to an entire HTML web
      page. Think of all the HTML elements you know.
      You can now change the color of anything! However, once again, you're probably already asking questions about the
      shortcomings that might accompany using the
      style tag in the head of your document.
    </p>
    <p>Questions like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What if I have a lot of CSS rules? My head element will be really big.</li>
      <li>What if I want to share the same styles across multiple pages?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The final (most widely accepted) way to incorporate CSS into HTML is through using external stylesheets.</p>
    <h3>External Styles</h3>
    <p>
      You can link to a separate CSS file where you save all of your rules apart from your HTML. This answers both of
      the questions above, because now you can reference
      as many external stylesheets as you need, and you only need a single line of code for each stylesheet. Let's see
      what that looks like:
    </p>
    <p>Your <strong>index.html</strong> file would contain the following:</p>
    <textarea rows="14">
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>CSS Playground</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Let's Paint the Town</h1>
    <p>I'm excited you're starting your CSS journey. Let's learn how to style together!</p>
    <p>We'll be stronger together, and learning CSS while expanding your knowledge of HTML is the way to go.</p>
  </body>
</html>
      </textarea>
    <p>While your <strong>styles.css</strong> file would contain the rule:</p>
    <textarea rows="4">
p {
  color: royalblue;
}
      </textarea>
    <p>
      By adding the link element, identifying the relative reference as being to a stylesheet, and through using the
      href attribute to refer to the location of that stylesheet,
      you tell the browser what CSS rules to apply to the HTML document it just received. The CSS sheet referenced can
      contain any number of rules.

    <h2>Advanced Selectors</h2>
    <h4>Combined</h4>
    <p>
      If you need more precision in how to select elements and apply CSS rules to them, then you can combine different
      types of selectors.
      For example, combine both element and class selectors to target subsets of elements. For example, displaying
      priority items inside of a list.
    </p>

    <div class="code">
      <figure>
        <figcaption>HTML</figcaption>
        <script>

        </script>
        <textarea class="language-html" readonly rows="7">
    <ul>
      <li class="priority">Find a water supply</li>
      <li>Choose a location</li>
      <li>Build connecting roads</li>
    </ul>
</textarea>

      </figure>
      <figure>
        <figcaption>CSS</figcaption>
        <pre><code contenteditable><style contenteditable>
  li.priority {
    font-weight: bold;
  }
</style></code>
</pre>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <figcaption>Display</figcaption>
        <ul>
          <li class="priority">Find a water supply</li>
          <li>Choose a location</li>
          <li>Build connecting roads</li>
        </ul>
      </figure>

    </div>
    <h4>Hierarchy</h4>
    <p>Define hiearchies by putting a space between selectors:</p>
    <div class="code">
      <figure>
        <figcaption>HTML</figcaption>
        <textarea rows="5" readonly>
  <p>In Alex Proyas Dark City, Dr. Schreber's opening lines set the tone for the film, <q>First came darkness, then came the strangers.</q></p>
          </textarea>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <figcaption>CSS</figcaption>
        <pre><code><style contenteditable>
  p q {
    font-style: italic;
  }
          </style></code></pre>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <figcaption>Display</figcaption>
        <p>In Alex Proyas Dark City, Dr. Schreber's opening lines set the tone for the film, <q>First came darkness,
            then came the strangers.</q></p>
      </figure>
    </div>
    <p>And the resulting display of quotes inside of paragraph elements in the document will be italicized, as you see
      above.</p>
    <h4>Pseudo-class</h4>
    <h2>Typography</h2>
    <p>Introduction paragraph on typography</p>
    <h3>Units</h3>
    <h4>Absolute</h4>
    <p>Absolute units can be more difficult to make responsive and scalable.</p>
    <h5>Pixels (PX)</h5>
    <p>Not actually always 1px on your screen do to the different types of displays</p>
    <h5>Points (PT)</h5>
    <h5>Centimeters (CM)</h5>
    <h5>Inches (IN)</h5>
    <h5>Millimeters (MM)</h5>
    <h4>Relative</h4>
    <p>Relative units are designed to be used with changing screen sizes.</p>
    <h5>Relative Units (EM)</h5>
    <p>Typically used with font sizes where 1em is equal to the font-size of the parent element. 1em is 100% of the font
      size.</p>
    <p>Very useful for when an element should scale based off its parent element.</p>
    <h5>Root EMs (REM)</h5>
    <p>Relative to the root element's font size, so a relative unit based off a single absolute value. This makes using
      REMs generally more reliable.</p>
    <h5>View Height (VH)</h5>
    <p>The viewport is the seeable space presented by the browser in which the content of your page lives. This changes
      as a user resizes their browser window.</p>
    <p>View Height (vh) units are a relative stand in for percetanges, so 1vh is equivalent to 1% of the height of the
      viewport.</p>
    <h5>View Width (VW)</h5>
    <h5>Percentage (%)</h5>
    <p>Always set relative to another value, which is sometimes the element itself or the parent element</p>
    <h2>Positioning</h2>
    <p>vh and vw</p>
    <p>percentages</p>
    <h2>Box Model</h2>
    <h2>Display</h2>
    <h2>Grid</h2>
