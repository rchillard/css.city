    <h1>Learn Colors</h1>
    <p>
      Color can be expressed in four different formats. There are a limited number of <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value">named colors</a>,
      and then there are colors defined by specific values. For colors defined by specific values, CSS offers three
      different ways to express them:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hexadecimal</li>
      <li>Hue, Saturation, Lightness (HSL)</li>
      <li>Red, Green, Blue (RGB)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each format has advantages and disadvantages. For starters, let's see the same named color, royalblue, in all the
      formats:
    </p>
    <textarea rows="19">
p {
  color: royalblue;
}

/* Hexadecimal */
p {
  color: #4169e1;
}

/* Hue, Saturation, Lightness */
p {
  color: hsl(225, 73%, 57%);
}

/* Red, Green Blue */
p {
  color: rgb(65, 105, 225);
}
      </textarea>
    <p>
      Each one of the rules above will make the paragraph elements on a page the same color blue. So if they're all the
      same, you're probably wondering, why does CSS offer so
      many ways of doing the same thing, defining color?
    </p>
    <p>
      It all comes down to different use cases and who is defining color and consuming color.
    </p>
    <h2>Hexadecimal</h2>
    <p>
      Hexadecimal is the most common way you see colors defined, because a single numerical value can represent an
      entire color. When designing your own styles, you will most likely
      find yourself using a color picker like this one (click the input below):
    </p>
    <input type="color" value="#4169e1">
    <p>
      The color picker tells you the values in each format (HSL, RGB) for the given color you've chosen, and the
      hexadecimal value appears in the "Color name:"
      field. Having a color represented as a single value is useful because it's easier for you to work with one value
      in your code and to go from color picker directly to CSS.
      You just copy the "Color name" hexadecimal value from the picker and then paste that single value into your CSS,
      and you're off to a colorful race track!
    </p>
    <p>
      One shortcoming of defining colors in hexadecimal is that it's difficult for a human to read. The values are
      defined as #RRGGBB, meaning two place are saved for how much
      Red (RR), Green (GG), and Blue (BB) make up the whole color. However, it's hard to look at two colors, say
      #E71C1C, and #1C5AE7, and tell that they're a red and a blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Making color easier to understand for humans is where the Hue, Saturation, and Lightness color format come in to
      play.
    </p>
    <h2>Hue, Saturation, Lightness (HSL)</h2>
    <p>
      HSL was invented by a french engineer, Georges Valensi, who in 1938 was trying to solve a television broadcasting
      problem. TV broadcasters needed a way to maintain backwards
      compatability with monochrome (black and white) TV receivers and the new color TVs. Luminance (how much black or
      white existed) was broadcast as an unmodified value, so Mr. Valensi
      came up with the HSL color space in order to support color, while still maintaining compatability with existing
      monochrome TVs.
    </p>
    <h3>Hue</h3>
    <p>
      HSL color space is shaped as a cylinder, so the first attribute, <strong>hue</strong>, has an acceptable range
      aligned with the number of degrees in a circle (360). The hue
      (also called chroma) value chosen is essentially the base color. To see what I mean, I have created a table of
      color values below along with their hues, so you can see how each
      30 degree "chunk" of the circle corresponds to actual colors. You can click on any of these color picker inputs to
      see how hue changes.
    </p>
    <table style="border: 1px solid black">
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">Name</th>
        <td>red</td>
        <td>orange</td>
        <td>yellow</td>
        <td>lime</td>
        <td>green</td>
        <td>irish</td>
        <td>cyan</td>
        <td>azure</td>
        <td>blue</td>
        <td>purple</td>
        <td>magenta</td>
        <td>hot pink</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">Hue</th>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>30</td>
        <td>60</td>
        <td>90</td>
        <td>120</td>
        <td>150</td>
        <td>180</td>
        <td>210</td>
        <td>240</td>
        <td>270</td>
        <td>300</td>
        <td>330</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">Color</th>
        <td><input type="color" value="#FF0000"></td>
        <td><input type="color" value="#FF8000"></td>
        <td><input type="color" value="#FFFF00"></td>
        <td><input type="color" value="#80FF00"></td>
        <td><input type="color" value="#00FF00"></td>
        <td><input type="color" value="#00FF80"></td>
        <td><input type="color" value="#00FFFF"></td>
        <td><input type="color" value="#0080FF"></td>
        <td><input type="color" value="#0000FF"></td>
        <td><input type="color" value="#8000FF"></td>
        <td><input type="color" value="#FF00FF"></td>
        <td><input type="color" value="#FF0080"></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      So now, if you remember that Red is when Hue is 0, Green is when Hue is 120, and Blue is when Hue is 240, then for
      colors defined in the HSL format, you can pretty easily tell
      which ballpark you're in, just by looking at a single value (the first one, Hue). That's why HSL is often referred
      to as a human readable or human digestible color format.
    </p>
    <p>
      When defining color using HSL in CSS, you use the following format: <br>
    <pre>
  color: hsl(hue, saturation, lightness);
</pre>
    </p>
    <p>Without knowing what saturation or lightness do, can you look at the CSS rule below and the hue value to guess
      the color?</p>
    <pre>
  <code>
  p {
    color: hsl(230,75%,90%);
  }
  </code>
</pre>
    <details>
      <summary>Guess the color before expanding this paragraph!</summary>
      <p style="color: #3956E6">
        Did you guess a shade of <strong>blue</strong>? If so, well done! If not, look at hues and colors above once
        more. See how the hue for azure is 210 and the hue for blue is 240?
        Since the hue in the CSS rule above is 230, between azure and blue, we could safely guess that the paragraph
        would be colored some shade of blue.
      </p>
    </details>
    <p>Next we're going to learn how the rest of the HSL color format is defined.</p>
    <h3>Saturation</h3>
    <p>
      Saturation is a value that ranges from 0-100% and it defines how much or how strong the color you've chosen
      appears. In our example below, we'll use purple to see how changing
      the saturation changes the color. A total lack of saturation (no color) leaves us with just white, while full
      saturation (all the color) results in a bold purple.
    </p>
    <table style="border: 1px solid black">
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">Saturation</th>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>20</td>
        <td>30</td>
        <td>40</td>
        <td>50</td>
        <td>60</td>
        <td>70</td>
        <td>80</td>
        <td>90</td>
        <td>100</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">Color</th>
        <td><input type="color" value="#FFFFFF"></td>
        <td><input type="color" value="#F2E6FF"></td>
        <td><input type="color" value="#E4CCFF"></td>
        <td><input type="color" value="#D7B3FF"></td>
        <td><input type="color" value="#C999FF"></td>
        <td><input type="color" value="#BC80FF"></td>
        <td><input type="color" value="#AE66FF"></td>
        <td><input type="color" value="#A14DFF"></td>
        <td><input type="color" value="#9333FF"></td>
        <td><input type="color" value="#8619FF"></td>
        <td><input type="color" value="#7900FF"></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <h3>Lightness</h3>
    <p>
      Lightness is a value that also ranges from 0-100%, but it defines how much black (0%) or white (100%) is in the
      color. As you can imagine, a total lack of lightness (0%) results
      in a block color, while full lightness (100%) gives you bright, fully lit colors.
    </p>
    <table style="border: 1px solid black">
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">Lightness</th>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>20</td>
        <td>30</td>
        <td>40</td>
        <td>50</td>
        <td>60</td>
        <td>70</td>
        <td>80</td>
        <td>90</td>
        <td>100</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">Color</th>
        <td><input type="color" value="#000000"></td>
        <td><input type="color" value="#000D1A"></td>
        <td><input type="color" value="#001A33"></td>
        <td><input type="color" value="#00274D"></td>
        <td><input type="color" value="#003466"></td>
        <td><input type="color" value="#004180"></td>
        <td><input type="color" value="#004E99"></td>
        <td><input type="color" value="#005BB3"></td>
        <td><input type="color" value="#0068CC"></td>
        <td><input type="color" value="#0075E6"></td>
        <td><input type="color" value="#0080FF"></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      Stepping back for a second to combine our new understanding for all three aspects of the HSL format:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hue: the basic color to be rendered</li>
      <li>Saturation: the amount or strength of that color</li>
      <li>Lightness: the brightness or lightness of that color</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It's now easier for us to return to our original guessing example and see how the different values effect the
      color rendered:
    </p>
    <pre>
  <code>
  p {
    color: hsl(230,75%,90%);
  }
  </code>
</pre>
    <p style="color: #3956E6">
      We definitely have a blue (hue = 230), there's a lot of blue (saturation = 75%), and it's a bright shade of blue
      (lightness = 90%).
    </p>
    <p>If HSL is easier for humans, then what about computers? How do they make sense of color? That's why we have RGB.
    </p>
    <h2>Red, Green, Blue (RGB)</h2>
    <p>
      The red, green, blue or RGB color model is based on adding three base colors together (you've probably already
      guessed which)
      to produce every other color in the rainbow. Unlike HSL where hue is essentially the color, RGB colors are
      determined by how much of
      each base color is present. RGB values can range from 0-255 with 0 representing none of the color being present
      and 255 representing
      the maximum of that color. The color notation is similar to that of HSL, except with rgb instead:
    </p>
    <pre>
  color: rgb(red,green,blue);
</pre>
    <table style="border: 1px solid black">
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">Values</th>
        <td>rgb(255,0,0)</td>
        <td>rgb(0,255,0)</td>
        <td>rgb(0,0,255)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">Color</th>
        <td><input type="color" value="#FF0000"></td>
        <td><input type="color" value="#00FF00"></td>
        <td><input type="color" value="#0000FF"></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>So, if you want a color like orange, then what colors combined make orange? Can you guess?</p>
    <details>
      <summary>Click here to see the answer!</summary>
      <p>To make orange you start with a lot of red (255) and then add about half green (125). You don't need any blue
        (0).</p>
      <pre>
  color: rgb(255,125,0)
</pre>
      <p>And you get a bright, strong, bold orange like this:</p>
      <input type="color" value="#FF7D00">
    </details>
    <p>That was probably pretty difficult to guess though, right?</p>
    <p>Imagine if you saw a color defined like this:</p>
    <textarea rows="4">
p {
  color: rgb(65, 105, 225);
}
      </textarea>
    <p>Any idea what color that might be?</p>
    <p>
      There's about 25% of the possible red, 40% of the possible green, and a large amount of blue 90%ish. It's probably
      a blue,
      and maybe it's some sort of green-ish blue, since there's so much green in it? I can't really tell what color this
      will end
      up as just based off the raw RGB values.
    </p>
    <p style="color: royalblue">Guess what? It's our original royalblue.</p>
    <input type="color" value="#4169e1">
    <p>That's why RGB is a color format designed for computers and electronic devices. It's not very human readable.</p>
    <p>So why does RGB exist?</p>
    <p>
      Well, the combination of 256 values (0 to 255) of each color means that 16,777,216 (256 * 256 *256) precisely
      defined colors are available in
      this color format. That's a huge color spectrum. Also, defining color in this way is easier, computationally, on
      computers.
      Today, that doesn't matter anymore, because computers are very fast, but when different color formats were being
      adopted by
      early computers, this mattered a lot.
    </p>

    <h3>Alpha Channel</h3>
    <p>
      Finally, for both RGB and HSL color definitions, you have the option of adding an additional dimension for
      transparency. This is called the
      alpha channel, and it defines how transparent the color renders. The values for Alpha range from 0-1 with 0
      representing full transparency
      (invisible) and 1 representing full color (no transparency). This royalblue definition using rgba is the same as
      not specifying alpha:
    </p>
    <textarea rows="4">
p {
  color: rgba(65, 105, 225, 1)
}
</textarea>
    <p>
      The alpha channel is typically used for backgrounds, because it allows you to blend different colors together on
      multiple layers.
    </p>
    <textarea rows="5">
p {
  background-color: hsla(30, 75%, 57%, 0.25);
  color: hsla(225, 73%, 57%, 0.75);
}
</textarea>
    <p class="ex-alphachannel">
      Blending color with alpha opens another door to displaying elements together using CSS!
    </p>
    <p>The paragraph above actually has a bright, bold orange color selected for its background, but it's rendering as a
      faded orange because
      the alpha channel is telling the browser to only render it at 25% transparency. The same is true for the faded
      blue of the text, which
      is our same royalblue, but is now set at 75% transparency and is blending in with the background orange.
